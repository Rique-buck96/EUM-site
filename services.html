                <h2>Maintenance Audits</h2>
                <p class="lead">Provides auditing of complete Maintenance Management system of key elements to determine gaps and improvement opportunities against either ISO 55000 / PAS 55 or corporate standards. Our audits offer clients with a roadmap of improvement opportunities.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="wow fadeInDown">
                <h2>Maintenance Benchmarking</h2>
                <p class="lead">Benchmarking and competitive analysis shows where the pockets of excellence are, which can then be built on to improve the areas that are not performing quite as well. True benchmarking is comparing one organisation or asset against another which is widely recognised as the best within that industry.
                    <br>
                    <br>The difficulties in this arise in being able to identify the best organisation or asset and also in being able to gain entry into that organisation or asset to be able to witness and document what they are doing that is better. We provide benchmarking studies to determine the effectiveness of your current maintenance strategy & philosophy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="wow fadeInDown">
                <h2>Maintenance Strategy Development</h2>
                <p class="lead">We help our clients prioritize which assets require detailed maintenance assessment and which should simply receive OEM based maintenance in the form of maintenance philosophy & strategy development.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="wow fadeInDown">
                <h2>Reliability Improvement Program</h2>
                <p class="lead">To remain competitive and maximise the economic life of a field, resources must be used in the most efficient and effective ways. Those resources include both the financial and human resources of the company. Loss usually has the narrow focus of production loss but man hours and Opex losses can be tracked through the CMMS. Revisiting the same malfunctions reduces the Opex and man hours available for scheduling backlog or improvement work. We are able to provide comprehensive reviews of your existing facilities in order to identify quick wins and a long term sustainable reliability improvement program.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="wow fadeInDown">
                <h2>Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA)</h2>
                <p class="lead">FMECA studies carried out early in the design phase are used to identify failure modes and reliability issues that may cause performance weaknesses or costly design changes after operation has commenced. A FMECA study considers each mode of failure of every component of a system and determines the effects on system operation of each failure mode in turn. Failure modes are classified in relation to likelihood of the failure occurring and severity of the effects of the failure. Likelihood in combination with severity will generate a criticality rating for each failure mode which is based upon a predetermined risk matrix. We support our clients with FMECA workshops using the best in class software tools and experienced consultants.</p>

            <div class="wow fadeInDown">
                <h2>Reliability, Availability, Maintainability modelling/ RAM studies</h2>
                <p class="lead">A Reliability, Availability and Maintainability (RAM) model can be a key strategic tool. RAM models can be developed for brownfield sites and at any stage during the operate phase of the life cycle. If there is the opportunity though to develop it during the design process it can be used to maximise reliability and availability in the design. The information can also be used to develop life cycle costs for the plant. This type of information is critical when comparing alternative design options or equipment choices. The cheapest design option to purchase may have significantly increased operate and maintain costs.
                    <br>
                    <br>If the RAM model is developed during the design phase, the manufacturers’ data for equipment reliability and maintenance schedules should be used. When decisions are to be made on design options for equipment choices the RAM model will be invaluable tool to trial the options and be able to be used as justification for the decision made. We are able to model your facilities in order to optimize both reliability and lifecycle cost.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="wow fadeInDown">
                <h2>Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) planning</h2>
                <p class="lead">RCM is an industrial improvement approach, focused on identifying and establishing the operational, maintenance and capital improvement strategies that will manage the risks of equipment failure most effectively. With the application of RCM principles, maintenance is evaluated and applied in a rational manner that provides the most value to a system’s owner/ manager/ operator. We can discuss your specific requirements in regards to RCM and confirm the likely cost benefit of such a program for your facilities.</p>

            <div class="wow fadeInDown">
                <h2>Spare Parts Modelling</h2>
                <p class="lead">Having the right spares and materials available when needed, to perform both planned and unplanned maintenance, is clearly essential to reliability and safety.
                    <br>
                    <br>We analyze and model our clients spares requirements and holdings , resulting in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improved service levels</li>
                    <li>Mitigation of production risks</li>
                    <li>Enhanced reliability and safety of assets and infrastructures</li>

                <h2>CMMS Development & Optimisation</h2>
                <p class="lead">The purpose of CMMS is to improve utilization and performance of a company’s assets, reduce capital costs, reduce asset-related operating costs, extend asset life and ultimately improve ROA. Ensuring the resources required to create and maintain a CMMS are optimal will prevent inaccuracies of information and inappropriate maintenance applications, reducing workload and eliminating frustration. There are 5 distinctive but inter related sections to a new CMMS build. When maintaining an existing CMMS any section can be isolated, then re-introduced seamlessly with minimal operational impact.
                    <br>
                    <br>The sections are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Asset Register</li>
                    <li>Maintenance Strategies</li>
                    <li>Maintenance System Build</li>
                    <li>O&M Procedures</li>
                    <li>O&M Spares </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="lead">We assist our clients in CMMS build & optimization using our own proprietary tools to ensure data integrity and completeness resulting in improved performance and cost savings.</p>

                <h2>Hazard Identification (HAZID)/ Hazard & Operability Studies (HAZOP)</h2>
                <p class="lead">Hazard identification uses checklists of hazards to pinpoint material, system, process, and facility characteristics that could produce undesirable consequences through the occurrence of an incident. Possible means of eliminating the hazards or controlling the risk are usually identified. HAZID (HAZard IDentification) is a high-level, systematic study of process hazards. It is used for early identification of hazards and is typically applied at the conceptual or detailed design stage. On the other hand, HAZOP (Hazard & Operability Studies) is a well-known documented study that is used to verify the design or procedures integrity with respect to safety and operability. The purpose of the HAZOP is to investigate how system or plants deviate from the design intent, and create risk for personnel, equipment and operability problems.
                    <br>
                    <br>We can support your team in defining the key Hazards using one of our principal consultants as a workshop facilitator or we can review you current Hazard register to determine completeness or fit for intended application.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="wow fadeInDown">
                <h2>Quantified Risk Assessments (QRA)</h2>
                <p class="lead">Satisfactory demonstration of acceptable risk levels is often a requirement in, for example, the approval of major hazard plant construction plans, or significant changes to operations which may include areas such as plant modification and changes in operational manning levels.
                    <br>
                    <br>Facilities requiring QRA studies may include production and processing facilities, high pressure pipelines or storage and importation sites including liquefied natural gas (LNG).
                    <br>
                    <br>QRA may be a requirement of applicable legislation and/or internal company governance to show that risks are identified and controlled to an acceptable level. The criteria for risk acceptability may be defined by local regulations or company/ investor policy.
                    <br>
                    <br>Typically, a QRA can be defined as the formal and systematic approach of identifying potentially hazardous events, estimating the likelihood and consequences of those events, and expressing the results as risk to people, the environment or the business.
                    <br>
                    <br>The method may include some or all of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An analysis of the severity/consequence of accident scenarios</li>
                    <li>Predicted number of fatalities/casualties for each scenario</li>

                    <li>Group/societal risk</li>
                    <li>Potential loss of life</li>
                    <li>Location specific risk</li>
                    <li>Further analysis of accident scenarios that are ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable)</li>

                <p class="lead">EUM is able to support its clients through, for example, the undertaking of QRA studies to identify potential accident scenarios which contribute most to the overall risk of an operational facility, allowing focus to be placed on means to minimise or mitigate risks to meet appropriate acceptability criteria and/or demonstrating that the risks are as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP).</p>

                <h2>Hazard and Effects Management Process (HEMP)</h2>
                <p class="lead">The Hazards and Effects Management Process (HEMP) evolved in the chemical process industry as a methodology to ensure consistency in risk mitigation. In a nutshell, HEMP defines the manner in which the risk of injury to personnel, or damage to assets, environment, or reputation, is managed to As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP). It is simply a systematic method of identifying hazards, assessing risk, putting controls in place to guard against those risks and defining recovery measures should an incident happen. From this assessment, weaknesses in controls and recovery measures are identified and a remedial action plan is formed.
                    <br>
                    <br>Adequate “Planning and Procedures” are required with respect to operations conducted in the business. This part of the management system also deals with the formation and testing of Emergency Response Plans.
                    <br>
                    <br>The implementation phase comes next. Within this Implementation, Monitoring and Reporting phase targets are set, key performance indicators are developed and monitored and incidents (actual and potential) are reported and investigated so that learning points can be fed back into the management system.
                    <br>
                    <br>Finally, there is a formal system of Audit and Management Review. An independent and internal HSSE audit programme should be included to regularly review the management system to ensure appropriate coverage of risks in the changing business environment.</p>
